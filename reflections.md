> ## Score:
> 
> Play with rhythmic generation through setting up content for the granulator to freeze and generate texture (given a square vave control freeze trigger) 
> 
> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/83i5zwp.png">
> 
> Play with the first 4 prototype knobs to vary timbres produced - some have directly gitchy effects while moved.
> 
> The top highlighted vcf acts as a filter for various frequency components of the generated audio - sweep in.
> 
> The bottom highlighted lfo-1 controls the triggering of granulator freezes and texture cv.
> 
> Play with the blend knob on texture synth to define how clean the signal out is.

by 00:08 there's a high pitch hanging in the background that feels like gentle pressure just in front of my right ear - the sensation resolves into relaxation of the TMJ at 1:24-6

the scratching at 00:15 feels like a dentist drilling under anesthesia...

around 00:30 I'm starting to wonder if the sound that began at 00:28 is morse code... it seems to run through most of the recording

01:02 [auditory hallucination] someone blows out a candle or tries to whistle (hwha)

01:15 [AH] felt tip marker (the cheap kind, not a Sharpie) writing on a flip chart in a shipping container dissolves into crackling faint morse code through the radio at 01:20

Visual Imagery triggered is generally militaristic, definitly giving a mission briefing using a flip chart in a shipping container, morse code from a weak radio signal, intercepting dial-up satellite communications...change the channel to a humming bird in a vise 

After repeated listing, I'm starting to hear the high pitched sratching and scraping noises from the recording when I rub my fingers or adjust my sleeves.

My outer ears (just the inner folds not the outer edge) feel like there's a low level electric current running through them.

Listening 3 times in a row leaves pink noise playing in my ears and tension in my left TMJ

On playing with the instrument, the score provided is much more broadly instructional in how to use the instrument generally as opposed to documenting the specific manipulations required to reproduce the recording... I'm not too unhappy about not having replicated the high pitch in the background ;)  All of the pictured component blocks are present now that I've moved to the MacOS environment.

If all I have the ability to percieve is low frequencies then the recording is almost entirely imperceptible.  There is a single detectible pulse at 00:58 and possiblly faintly perceptible vibratons from 00:42-54 and 01:09-12.

Having the recording and being forced with this challenge led me to develop a Max patch that I can use to analyze the frequencies visually to try to understand what the piece is doing.  Inspired by Christine Sun Kim's description of the physical symptoms she experienced after working with feedback, I'm inspired to research more about sound's impact on human bodies beyond it's auditory perception and interpretation.
