>## Knobs

>it's fun to have fun but you have to know how...

>### K1-4

>These babies on the Prototype module require a very fine touch, gently make small adjustments and leave a few seconds for the full impact to take hold... flipping them quickly results in lots of timbural turbulence (aka noise)



>### Freq Dot

>The LFO-1 module has an LED indicator that warns you when things are getting a little over powering, located right next to the lable for the Freqency knob and it appreciates big sweeps!

First, it started as the sound of a drilling machine in the street you hear in a Monday morning.

At 00:20 a brief sound of pouring water can be heard and till 23 it happens to feel like a cricket singing in the dark.

At 27-36 it feels like a morse code being transmitted through my ears.

At 37, slightly you can hear the cricket again along with morse code and at 38-52, it changes to a high frequency vibration of a small electric motor which has been turned on, on the surface of a wooden table and closer to 48 it's being moved by a human operator which changes the intensity of those frequencies.

From 52 to 60, it sounds like a motorcycle roaring while standing and from 60 to 63 it sound like that motor is on the way and is moving with a steady speed.

At 63-68 it sounds like a recorded sound of a professional typer on an old typing machine which is been playing in the background with 2X speed.

68-70, sound of a cell phone ringing on the side-bed table.

70-73 sound of moving newspapers while changing pages.

73-78 sounds like a thin plastic bag is touching the blades of a high speed fan.

79-86 sounds like cutting with a high speed saw through a wet piece of wood.

At the end of the file, it sounds like a spaceship in a scify game is shooting its enemies non-stop.
