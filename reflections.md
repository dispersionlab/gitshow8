by 00:08 there's a high pitch hanging in the background that feels like gentle pressure just in front of my right ear - the sensation resolves into relaxation of the TMJ at 1:24-6

the scratching at 00:15 feels like a dentist drilling under anesthesia...

01:04 someone blows out a candle or tries to whistle (hwha)
