## Score:

Thank you to the previous author for giving me a real challenge right away - the prompt to ask for accommodations right up front was so helpful and inspiring - please accept my appologies for cursing at you last week.

Play with rhythmic generation through setting up content for the granulator to freeze and generate texture (given a square vave control freeze trigger)

Play with the first 4 prototype knobs to vary timbres produced - some have directly gitchy effects while moved.

The top highlighted vcf acts as a filter for various frequency components of the generated audio - sweep in.

The bottom highlighted lfo-1 controls the triggering of granulator freezes and texture cv.

Play with the blend knob on texture synth to define how clean the signal out is.
