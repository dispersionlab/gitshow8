## Knobs
it's fun to have fun but you have to know how...
### K1-4
These babies require a very fine touch, gently make small adjustments and leave a few seconds for the full impact to take hold... flipping them quickly results in lots of timbural turbulence (aka noise)

### Freq Dot
The LFO-1 module has an LED indicator that warns you when things are getting a little over powering, located right next to the lable for the Freqency knob and it appreciates big sweeps!
